      <div class="introText">"Protect vision for the revolution, prevent myopia, start eye exercises
      now, close your eyes..." This set of eye exercises accompanied by soothing
      music, together with the crisp child's voice shouting beats, is very
      important to many Chinese who have passed middle age in the 21st century.
      Still kind and familiar. As early as 1972, the National Education
      Commission of China stipulated that primary school students should perform
      eye exercises between classes twice a day. Over the years, this has become
      an eye-care program in every school. Every Chinese teenager joins the
      ranks of doing eye exercises from the moment they step into the school
      gate. Eye Exercises is a tradition of Chinese campus culture. It has been
      integrated into the lives of generations and carries the memories of
      generations.

         look at your eyes in the screen. make eye contact with your eyes, with your eyes. look with your eyes, into your eyes. do you know this person? do you know what they are thinking about?
consider, what have these eyes seen? what have they been witness to? take a fingertip to you forhead right at the top of your hairline. Begin to draw a spiral around your face very slowly. this spiral will end directly in between your eyes. when moving the spiral across each eye, whisper to yourself somethng that eye has seen in your life, every time your fingertip grazes an eye. be careful not to poke your eye out. go very slowly and as the spiral moves around your face think of what you will say the next time the fingertip crosses your eye. as the spiral moves inward, the time between whispering things you have seen decreases.
